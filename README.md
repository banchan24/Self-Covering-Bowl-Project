# Self-Covering-Bowl-Project
A smart, self-covering bowl designed to prevent accidental spills during mealtime for toddlers and young children.   When the built-in **tilt sensor** detects the bowl tipping, **servo motors** activate a protective **awning** that slides over the top of the bowl, keeping the food contained.

The **Unspillabowl** is built to help parents and caregivers keep mealtime mess-free.  
Our primary users are **children aged 1–5**, who are often prone to knocking over their bowls. This project minimizes food waste, saves cleanup time, and makes mealtime stress-free.

Objectives
- Reduce **food waste** by preventing spills.
- Promote **cleanliness** and hygiene around eating areas.
- Ensure **child safety** with non-toxic, stable materials.
- Offer **caregiver convenience** with easy-to-clean, automatic operation.

How It Works
1. **Tilt Detection** – Sensors monitor the bowl’s angle at all times.  
2. **Servo Activation** – If the tilt crosses a set threshold, servo motors trigger the awning.  
3. **Spill Prevention** – The awning slides forward, covering the bowl to contain food.  
4. **Automatic Reset** – When the bowl returns upright, the awning retracts automatically.

Components
- **Tilt Sensor** – Detects the degree of tipping.  
- **Servo Motors** – Actuate the protective awning.  
- **Awning Cover** – Food-safe, lightweight material that slides to seal the bowl.  
- **Bowl Base** – Non-slip surface for added stability.  
- **Controller Board (e.g., Arduino)** – Coordinates sensor input and motor output.  
- **Power Supply** – Safe, low-voltage source for household use.
