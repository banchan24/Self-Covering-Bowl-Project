# Self-Covering-Bowl-Project
A smart, self-covering bowl designed to prevent accidental spills during mealtime for toddlers and young children.   When the built-in **tilt sensor** detects the bowl tipping, **servo motors** activate a protective **awning** that slides over the top of the bowl, keeping the food contained.
